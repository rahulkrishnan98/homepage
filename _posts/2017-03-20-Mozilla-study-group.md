## The 21’st Century classroom

This unique project by mozilla is aimed at enhancing peer-to-peer interaction and notching up the right balance of online teaching and learning. As quoted in the community website they seek to _support this kind of peer-to-peer study by providing a simple set of tools, template lesson plans, and access to an international community of like-minded researchers and avid learners in code_. They’re fun, informal meet-ups allowing participants to share skills, experiences, and ideas around open science, open source, code, and community in research.Where? Who? When? Answering the first question, there are already existing study groups in several locations across the globe. Don't fret if you can find one near you, just create one instead. The projects time-frames and extended details are clearly mentioned in [here](https://mozillascience.github.io/study-group-orientation/).

> Locations Of present study groups across the globe

Attending to the second question, the people behind it are a group of highly motivated and inspiring individuals who know how to get the job done. You can reach out to **Zannah Marsh, Mozilla's Learning Strategist, or Aurelia Moser, Mozilla's Community Lead**. The best way to do this is file a [GitHub issue in this Study Group Orientation repository](https://github.com/mozillascience/study-group-onboarding/issues), or [ping us on the Gitter Chat](https://gitter.im/mozillascience/studyGroup). The group is presently working on ways to provide all the data on science group in an interactive UI dashboard. Presently the information is logged in via various parameters, one of which is shown below.

The visualizations are set to take form in the main mozilla science-lab webpage as an extended addition to the [study groups page](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/studygroups). This has really sought my attention and I would like to work on it through the summer. Also the Mozilla community has been very welcoming and prompt and am loving every moment here.

### I am convinced! Where do I go now?

With such a large community such as Mozilla the opportunities are boundless. Right now you could start working in the science-lab repository [here](https://github.com/mozilla/science.mozilla.org). Thank you guys, thats all for now, stay tuned for more from the community right here.
